=== AI-POWERED COMMAND PARSING DEMO ===

The new system uses AI to understand user intent, regardless of:
- Typos
- Language
- Phrasing variations

EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOW WORKS:

📝 APPROVAL COMMANDS (all map to plan-approval-task):
- @l approve          ✅ Standard English
- @l aprove           ✅ Typo handling
- @l yes              ✅ Short form
- @l ys               ✅ Typo of "yes"
- @l ok               ✅ Casual approval
- @l oke              ✅ Typo of "ok"
- @l ship it          ✅ Developer slang
- @l lgtm             ✅ "Looks good to me"
- @l looks good       ✅ Natural language
- @l go ahead         ✅ Natural approval
- @l let's do this    ✅ Enthusiastic approval

🌍 MULTILINGUAL APPROVAL:
- @l sí               ✅ Spanish
- @l oui              ✅ French  
- @l ja               ✅ German
- @l да               ✅ Russian
- @l sim              ✅ Portuguese
- @l 是的             ✅ Chinese
- @l はい             ✅ Japanese
- @l 네               ✅ Korean
- @l evet             ✅ Turkish
- @l نعم              ✅ Arabic

🔧 OTHER COMMANDS WITH TYPO TOLERANCE:
- @l refien           → refine (typo)
- @l cancle           → cancel (typo)
- @l reveiw           → review (typo)
- @l plna             → plan (typo)

🎯 SMART INTENT RECOGNITION:
- @l yup let's go     → approval + execute
- @l nah cancel this  → cancel
- @l hmm maybe refine → refine
- @l start now        → execute

=== HOW IT WORKS ===

1. User types command (any language, with typos)
2. AI analyzes intent using GPT-4o-mini
3. Returns structured classification:
   {
     "intent": "approval",
     "confidence": 0.95,
     "normalizedCommand": "approve",
     "language": "es"
   }
4. Maps to appropriate task type
5. Fallback to pattern matching if AI fails

=== KEY BENEFITS ===

✅ No more "command not recognized" for typos
✅ International users can use their native language
✅ Natural language understanding
✅ Context-aware (knows if you just created a milestone)
✅ Confidence scoring for better decisions
✅ Graceful fallback to ensure reliability

=== IMPLEMENTATION ===

The AI parser is in: src/lib/ai-command-parser.ts
Integration point: src/lib/command-parser.ts (getTaskType function)

Now when you type "@l approve", it will:
1. Extract "approve" from the command
2. Send to AI for intent classification
3. AI recognizes this as "approval" intent
4. Maps to "plan-approval-task"
5. Triggers the correct task (not codex/devving mode!)

The system is now much more user-friendly and intelligent! 🎉
