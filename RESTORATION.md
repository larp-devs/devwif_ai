# Repository Restoration Process

This document outlines the process that was followed to restore the uwularpy repository after a force push deleted existing files.

## Issue Summary

A force push to the repository accidentally deleted most of the existing files, leaving only a few updates. The repository was missing critical components:

1. Missing dependencies in package.json:
   - @octokit/auth-app
   - @octokit/rest
   - uwuify

2. Missing files and directories:
   - src/lib directory with github-auth.ts and uwuify.ts
   - Properly configured webhook route.ts file
   - Documentation files

## Restoration Process

The following steps were taken to restore the repository:

1. **Examination of Repository State**
   - Analyzed the current state of the repository
   - Identified all missing components and files

2. **Backup Creation**
   - Created a backup of the current state before making any changes
   - Preserved any existing files to avoid further data loss

3. **Repository Structure Restoration**
   - Created the missing src/lib directory
   - Added the github-auth.ts and uwuify.ts files
   - Restored the webhook route.ts file with the immediate reply feature
   - Added documentation files (DEPLOYMENT.md, TESTING.md)

4. **Package.json Update**
   - Added the missing dependencies to package.json:
     - @octokit/auth-app
     - @octokit/rest
     - uwuify
   - Preserved other necessary dependencies and configurations

5. **Git Challenges Resolution**
   - Handled divergent branches issue
   - Resolved "unrelated histories" error using --allow-unrelated-histories
   - Fixed merge conflicts in package.json
   - Pushed changes without using force to preserve repository history

## Lessons Learned

1. **Avoid Force Push**
   - Never use `git push -f` on shared repositories unless absolutely necessary
   - When force push is required, use it with extreme caution and specific branch targeting

2. **Regular Backups**
   - Maintain regular backups of critical repository code
   - Consider using GitHub Actions to automate backups

3. **Branch Protection**
   - Enable branch protection rules for important branches
   - Require pull requests for changes to main branch
   - Disable force pushes to protected branches

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Maintain the current structure with src/lib for shared utilities
   - Keep the webhook handler in src/app/api/webhook/route.ts

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies for security and performance
   - Ensure @octokit/auth-app, @octokit/rest, and uwuify remain in package.json

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation files up to date
   - Refer to DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment instructions
   - Refer to TESTING.md for testing procedures

4. **Version Control**
   - Use feature branches for new development
   - Create pull requests for code reviews
   - Avoid direct commits to main branch
   - Never use force push on shared branches
